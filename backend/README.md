# OrderFlow

OrderFlow is a backend-focused Order Management and Trade Processing platform inspired by real-world trading systems.

It demonstrates asynchronous processing, clean architecture, and extensible design patterns commonly used in large-scale backend systems.

---

## Tech Stack
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- REST APIs
- ExecutorService (Asynchronous processing)

---

## High-Level Architecture
- Layered Spring Boot application (Controller → Service → Execution Engine)
- Order submission is decoupled from order execution to avoid blocking request threads
- Asynchronous execution engine processes orders in background worker threads
- Strategy pattern is used to support different order execution behaviors

---

## Core Features
- Place orders via REST APIs
- Asynchronous order execution using a dedicated thread pool
- Strategy-based execution (Market / Limit)
- Order lifecycle management (CREATED → EXECUTING → EXECUTED / FAILED)
- Structured error responses with error codes
- DTO-based API contracts (command vs query separation)

---

## Design Highlights
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- Asynchronous execution to improve throughput and protect request threads
- Strategy pattern for extensibility without modifying core logic
- Command vs Query DTO separation for clean API contracts
- Centralized exception handling with structured error responses
- Concurrency handled using ExecutorService to isolate execution workloads
- **Idempotent order placement using client-supplied Idempotency-Key**
- **Database-enforced uniqueness to guarantee exactly-once order creation**

---

## Deployment

The application is fully Dockerized and can be run locally using Docker Compose.

- Spring Boot backend and PostgreSQL run as separate containers
- Environment-based configuration is used for database connectivity
- Docker Compose manages service orchestration and networking

This setup enables consistent local development and mirrors real-world deployment practices.

---

## API Overview
- `POST /orders` → Place a new order
- `GET /orders/{id}` → Fetch order details

---

## API Semantics

### Idempotent Order Placement

The `POST /orders` endpoint supports **idempotent order creation** using the
`Idempotency-Key` request header.

- For a given `(userId, Idempotency-Key)` combination, only **one order** is created.
- Retrying the same request with the same key returns the **original order**.
- Duplicate requests do **not** trigger duplicate executions.

Idempotency is enforced using:
- A **database-level unique constraint** on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`
- **Service-layer logic** to safely handle concurrent requests

This guarantees **exactly-once order creation** even under retries or concurrent submissions.

---

## Credentials & Configuration

This project uses **environment-based configuration** for database connectivity.

- Database credentials are **not hardcoded** in the application or Docker image.
- Credentials are injected at runtime using **environment variables** via Docker Compose.
- A local `.env` file can be used for convenience and is **excluded from version control**.

This approach ensures that:
- Docker images remain environment-agnostic
- Sensitive information is not committed to source control
- Configuration can vary across environments (local, CI, production)

> **Note:** The credentials used in this repository are **dummy values for demonstration purposes only** and must be replaced with secure secrets in real deployments.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Kafka-based event-driven execution
- Retry and failure handling with dead-letter queues
- Microservices decomposition
- Cloud deployment

These enhancements are planned to demonstrate system evolution from a monolith to a scalable, event-driven architecture.
